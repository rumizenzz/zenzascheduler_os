# TASK: Build ZenzaLife Scheduler - Comprehensive Family Life Management Platform

## Objective: Create a full-stack multi-user scheduler and life-management platform that goes beyond calendaring to track habits, family growth, milestones, and enable "1% better" daily progress for individuals and families.

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: World-class, dreamlike, cinematic experience
- Evoke a serene, cloud-like lucid dream space (think "Vanilla Sky" aesthetic)
- Every screen, animation, and transition should feel calming, seamless, and inviting
- Color palettes inspire clarity, hope, and gentle motivation - never stress or confusion
- Users should feel they're organizing life in a beautiful, serene, almost magical environment
- Far beyond any ordinary calendar or scheduler - this is elevated life management

## ðŸŒŒ DREAMLIKE ENTRANCE EXPERIENCE - EVERY TIME (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**Critical UX Requirement:** Every login, app open, or refresh must create a ritualistic, cinematic entrance

### Visual Experience:
- Gentle, flowing animations creating sensation of entering magical, weightless environment
- Visual style immediately invoking Vanilla Sky and lucid dream movies - expansive, light, beautiful
- Landing screen with subtle motion: clouds drifting, light particles, gentle gradients
- Typography, colors, micro-interactions, button hovers all reinforce "lucid dream" aesthetic
- No harshness, no stress - only clarity and hope

### Audio Experience:
- Cinematic entrance sound plays every time main screen loads
- Options: gentle chime, airy pad, or soft whoosh
- Reinforces dreamlike state and "otherworldly" space entry
- Optional skip/mute after few seconds, but plays by default

### Emotional Impact:
- Not just productivity app - emotional and cinematic experience
- Users feel inspired, calm, elevated - entering higher dreamlike version of themselves
- Deepens ritual, anticipation, and positive emotional association
- Sets tone for entire platform experience
